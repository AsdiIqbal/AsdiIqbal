# Hi there, I'm Asad Iqbal.👋 
I am a Mechatronics graduate with a soft spot for Artificial Intelligence. I worked on a lot of projects in my academics timeline which covered the scope of research, analytics, programming and building tools. Since then, I have been learning my way in to AI development and Robotics.
Picture this: gears, circuits, and the thrill of coding—yeah, that's my jam. But what really gets my neurons firing is the incredible dance between machines and intelligence. AI is not just a trend for me; it's a playground where the future is unfolding in lines of code.
Along with my journey, I love to contribute to the community and pave some path for the coming ones.
